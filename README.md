## What are database migrations?

Database migrations (also known as schema migrations, database schema migrations, or simply migrations) are controlled sets of changes developed to modify the structure of objects in a relational database. Migrations help transition database schemas from their current state to a new desired state, whether that involves adding tables and columns, removing elements, splitting fields, or changing data types and constraints.

## What are the advantages of migration tools?

Migration tools are very useful because they allow the database schema to evolve as requirements change. They help developers plan, validate, and safely apply schema changes in their environments. These changes are broken down into detailed steps that describe what transformations need to occur to transition between different "versions" of the database.

## What are some disadvantages of migration tools?

However, migration systems are not without faults, but most of these errors can be minimized through proper processes and monitoring.

Since migrations modify the existing database structure, caution is needed to avoid data loss. This can happen due to incorrect assumptions made by the tool or because the transformations require a deep understanding of the data structure's meaning. While it may be easy to assume that the generated migration files are accurate, since they primarily relate to data structure, it is your responsibility to ensure that the data is preserved or transformed correctly.
